## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Boston AirBNB data from April 2021 to better understand:

1. Which neighborhood in Boston provides us the most choice to choose?
2. Which feature makes room prices increase?
3. Which room type is suitable for your budget?




## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://poltitor.medium.com/how-to-choose-your-airbnb-room-in-boston-f2530aee3791).
